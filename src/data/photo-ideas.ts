  "Mind posture: long neck, relaxed shoulders, gentle curves.",
  "Shoot from slightly above for softer lines; below for drama.",
  "Use the rule of odds: 1 or 3 points of interest (face, hands, legs).",
  "Background: clean and dark for contrast; remove clutter.",
  "Add motion: hair flip, step forward, turn head mid-laugh.",
  "Music and warm room = relaxed expressions and longer sessions."
